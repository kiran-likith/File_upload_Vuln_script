File Upload Vulnerability Enumerator

This project provides a powerful and modular Bash-based script to detect file upload vulnerabilities across web applications.
It integrates Nmap NSE
FFUF fuzzing, 
and custom upload payload testing to automate and document findings during advanced penetration tests or security research labs.

==> Suitable for: Bug bounty, red teaming, lab testing, and OSINT-based recon
==> Legal use only â€” test only on systems you own or are authorized to audit.

after saving in linux system give permission like:

#change permission
chmod +x file_upload_enum.sh

#run script
./file_upload_enum.sh <ipaddress>
